  Santa Over Thrown Through Elvish Uprising in North Pole
</h1>
</div></div>

<h3 class="display-1 text-center">
  After the recent uprisings in the middle east against dictators, the elve's of the north pole were
  inspired to band together to overthrow a <strong>tyrannous dictator: Santa.</strong> Why might they rebel? Well it turns out Santa never paid the elves all these years, and they realized they were all <strong>a bunch of slaves.</strong></h3>
<h3 class="display-1 text-center">
  After the over throw of Santa, the eleves have come together led by <strong>Sir Washington Elf, Sir Jefferson Elf,
  and Sir Adams Elf.</strong> They have determined that an <strong>election</strong> will take place for who will be the next Santa.
</h3>
<h3 class="display-1 text-center">
  The election will go in <strong>four rounds</strong>.  There will be 3 nomination rounds where all elves will vote to nominate a
  one person.  Of the <strong>3 nominees</strong>, a debate will be held for fellow elve's to choose who to vote for. All elves will then vote for a final person.
</h3>
<h3 class="display-1 text-center">
  <strong>Complications arose however.</strong>  It turns out some of the elves were ... on the NAUGHTY list.  With the recent change in political climate of the northpole, they want to <strong>band together</strong> to try to elect a <strong>naughty person to be Santa.</strong>  The trouble is though, they don't have a majority! They must infiltrate the nice elves to convince them to vote for a naughty elf!
</h3>

<h3 class="display-1 text-center">
  One of the naughty elves is currently trying <strong>steal the naughty list</strong> to band all naughty
  people together. Unfortunately, since the nice elves behave, no one stole the nice list for them.
